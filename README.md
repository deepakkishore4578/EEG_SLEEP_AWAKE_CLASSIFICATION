Sleep Stage Classification with Machine Learning
Various experiment with brain data to classify sleep stage using machine learning.

Currently, most of the code is being drafted here https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14Ram_eWOAu_JM-jKC0qySbU7dA8W1kan#scrollTo=yMZqCPMMeB7s

Experiment 1 : Polysomnography data with 2 participants
Code is mainly inspired by this tutorial in MNE python.

The methodology is inspired by this article titled A deep learning architecture for temporal sleep stage classification using multivariate and multimodal time series.

The data comes from this study and is called PhysioNet: PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet : Components of a New Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signal
